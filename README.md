# Toy Problems

This is a code challenge that serves to showcase three programs.
Each program has been designed to take in user input, evaluate it based on various conditions, and then print out an appropriate response.

## Description

The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate the following concepts:

- Writing functions in JavaScript that take in user data, analyse it and return useful information.
  
- The first program is a Grade Generator. It takes in an array of test scores and returns the letter grade associated with each score.
  
- The second program is a Speed Detector. It  should be able to detect whether an input number is within the bounds defined by an arbitrary regulatory body and return values that give a driver information on the status of their driving license in the form of demerit points.
  
- The third program is a Net Salary Calculator.  It should be able to calculate net salary for an employee given their basic pay and benefits, compute the statutory deductions and return their values along with their net pay.
